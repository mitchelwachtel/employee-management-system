### Description
This app is to be used to interact with your company's employee database. You have a table for your employees, departments, and roles. This app will allow you to view, add, update, and delete your employees, roles, and departments. Further, you can use this app to see the total salaries that have been commited for each department.

As a developer, this was the toughest project I've build to-date. I learned a lot about asynchronous functions and mysql queries. I'm proud of the very functional end result, but future development of this project would certainly include better organizing and cleaner writing of the functions used.
